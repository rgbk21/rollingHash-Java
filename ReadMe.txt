- Checking similarity between 2 documents
- implementation using Rabin Karp algorithm

Tuple: 
Stores strings as tuples
Value: string value
Key: Rollover hash value of string

Brute Force Similarity:
Comparing strings directly between 2 documents

Hash String Similarity:
Compares the rollover values as well as the string value of the strings

Hash Code Similarity:
Compares the rollover value of the strings only
